1
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,760
In this GP Racing.

2
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,680
News from the German grand
prix and a preview of Hungary.

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,800
A famous Alfa Romeo fires up.

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,800
And the story of the
ill-fated Manor F1 team.

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,630
Red Bull's Max Verstappen...

7
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,240
...won chaotic German
grand prix at Hockenheim...

8
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,240
...when the wet weather
livened up the race no end.

9
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,920
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel
delighted his home fans...

10
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,440
...by making his way up from
20th position to take 2nd.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,920
While Daniil Kvyat scored
a podium for Toro Rosso.

12
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,680
Two Honda powered
cars in the top three.

13
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,840
Racing Point's
Lance Stroll was fourth...

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,680
...Lewis Hamilton
eventually finished ninth...

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,310
...and Robert Kubica scored...

16
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,760
...William's first point
of the season in 10th.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,000
Hamilton extended his points
advantage over Valtteri Bottas...

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,280
...whose race ended
up in the gravel.

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,183
In the constructors
points Red Bull...

20
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:50,560
...is closing on Ferrari
for second place.

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,653
The next round of the
championship takes us to Budapest...

22
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,960
...for the 35th Hungarian
grand prix at the Hungaroring.

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,733
A regular on the F1 calendar since
1986, Lewis Hamilton has won...

24
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:13,360
...the race a record number of times
with six victories to his credit.

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,214
So, Budapest I think obviously
sweet memories from 2015 where...

26
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:20,920
...we were able to win the
race with after a fantastic start.

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,880
So, definitely looking forward to
go back and repeat what we did.

28
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,031
I think it's a great
place to be obviously...

29
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,743
...always got a lot
of fans...

30
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:31,679
...a lot of German
speaking fans as well...

31
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:33,640
...traveling from
Austria and Germany...

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,951
...and all the Hungarians
which usually are very very...

33
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,751
...enthusiastic and love
Formula one, being in town.

34
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:42,899
So, the whole city of Budapest
is enjoying Formula one...

35
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:46,120
...and usually on Sunday
there's a lot of people coming.

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
So, yeah overall I have
great memories to Budapest.

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
It's a beautiful city.

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,793
I enjoy staying there and
enjoy the restaurants...

39
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:01,480
...and the people as well just
really loving warm people.

40
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,360
The race in Hungary is
always a special one for me.

41
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,763
It's a race that I've won
quite a few times so...

42
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:12,280
...it's definitely circuits of
which I'm most confident at.

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,768
The track itself
is quite short and...

44
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:19,480
...often called the
Monaco of race tracks...

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,527
...just lacking the
walls but you have...

46
00:03:22,627 --> 00:03:24,993
...a lot of corners, you
have one big straight...

47
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:27,315
...the main straight
and after that a lot...

48
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,000
...of corners not much
time to rest in between.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,413
Usually, it's quite hot the
track is bumpy so, it makes it...

50
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:38,880
...quite tough and physically a
big challenge for the drivers.

51
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,560
But I think overall it's a
place that we love to go.

52
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,200
If you look on the most
critical part on the simulator.

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
It's turn five.

54
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,300
You come through turn four the
fast left and going into the right.

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,122
This part is almost the
trickiest but then you also...

56
00:03:57,222 --> 00:04:00,040
...could say the last corner
which goes on forever.

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
And it's very easy to kind of get
going too deep and lose the exit.

58
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,720
It's a circuit about
braking so heavy braking.

59
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,140
Getting the brake balance right.

60
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,280
The last sector is always tough
because the tires are so hot.

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,094
You have to be
really aggressive...

62
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:18,020
...and it's a bit more like
a go-kart circuit.

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,385
You can really throw around
the car, you really have to...

64
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,900
...attack the braking zones, you
have to be really aggressive.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,080
Throwing the car into the corner and
then trying to still get the exit.

66
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,240
The Hungarian grand
prix is on this weekend.

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,670
The Alfa Romeo 159...

68
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,600
...is one of the world's
great racing cars...

69
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,240
...and Alfa Romeo doesn't just
retain it as a museum piece.

70
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,120
The supercharged 1.5 liter straight
eight is kept ready to race.

71
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,680
And this was the race
that the similar 158 one.

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,873
The very first world
championship grand prix...

73
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:21,880
...held at Silverstone
in May 1950.

74
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,760
Italy's Nino Farina led an Alfa 153.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
Followed home by Luigi
Faggioli and Reg Parnell.

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,653
And driving the Alfa
Romeo, Farina went on...

77
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:42,440
...to become the first
ever world champion.

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,240
Coming up Italian F4 from
Vallelunga and the Hungaroring.

79
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,120
And the story of Manor f1.

80
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,533
Now we turn our attention
to what has become...

81
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:24,200
...an important stepping
stone to formula one.

82
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
The Italian Formula 4
championship.

83
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,933
The Italian F4 championship
powered by Abarth...

84
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:38,360
...starts its sixth season
with record numbers.

85
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,920
37 original entries and
33 of the cars would be present...

86
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,520
...at the first
round with the federation.

87
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,816
Actually, having to
close the entry list so as...

88
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,600
...not to exceed the track
capacity at some circuits.

89
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,000
And an incredible entry list it is.

90
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,240
Both in terms of quality
and the nationality of drivers.

91
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,038
English, Russians,
Brazilians, Finns...

92
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,800
...Israelis and more in
what is undoubtedly...

93
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,240
...the most international of the
national junior championships.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,595
In addition to the
fact that the best...

95
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:19,280
...teams in Europe are
present on the grid.

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,960
Including Prema Powerteam.

97
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
Van Amersfoort Racing.

98
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,480
Jenzer Motorsports.

99
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
VW Team Mï¿½cke Motorsport.

100
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,240
Cram Competition
and many others.

101
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,308
Many of the drivers
can boast titles...

102
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,920
...from the world of
international karting.

103
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,680
Including European and world
championships and WSK titles.

104
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,240
Along with drivers who have already
attracted the attention of teams...

105
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,800
...such as
Sauber, Ferrari and Red Bull.

106
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,411
So, without a doubt the strongest
continental f4 championship...

107
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,920
...got underway at Vallelunga
for the first round of 2019.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,240
A first round that actually
disappointed fans just a little.

109
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,813
Simply due to the many safety
cars that intervened due to...

110
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:17,360
...the at times horrendous
weather conditions at the circuit.

111
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,810
Between intense
rain and glimpses...

112
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,676
...of sunshine the standout
was the brilliant...

113
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:26,221
...performance of
Gianluca Petecof who...

114
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:28,840
...managed to take
poll for race one.

115
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,283
Yeah, it was a really
good session, tricky...

116
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,207
...conditions, track
drying up a little bit.

117
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,067
We were able to pull
the lap in the end...

118
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,640
...and guarantee pole position,
so happy with the session.

119
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,360
In race one the boy from
Brazil starts from pole position...

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,205
...and he leads on a
wet track remaining...

121
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,370
...on slick tires and
withstanding...

122
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,320
...the attacks from behind to
take the first win of the season.

123
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,113
In race two, he finishes
on the podium but is...

124
00:08:57,213 --> 00:09:00,280
...penalized for overtaking
behind the safety car.

125
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,480
But finally, he goes on to win race
three with an incredible last lap.

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,353
Passing both the
Russian Michael Belov...

127
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:13,760
...and the German Lucas Roy
Alecco to take the win.

128
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,640
A superb weekend for the
Prema Powerteam driver...

129
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,033
...who had to contend with...

130
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:21,960
...formidable and
aggressive opponents...

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,040
...and also the changing weather.

132
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,680
Also noteworthy are the performances
of the Czech Roman Stanek...

133
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,333
...a rookie driver
with the Sauber junior...

134
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:35,000
...team who despite
winning race two on track...

135
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,600
...suffered the same
fate as Petecof.

136
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,161
A 10 second penalty
for passing under yellows...

137
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:44,200
...and subsequent
relegation from victory.

138
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,240
And also, the Russian
Michael Belov...

139
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,054
...competitive all weekend
and able to fight with...

140
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:55,080
...Petecof until the very last
lap in race number three.

141
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,233
Josh Dirksen is the
best of the rookies and...

142
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,680
...is also second overall in
the general standings...

143
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,000
...behind the Brazilian Petecof.

144
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,960
The South American from
Paraguay Josh Dirksen...

145
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,971
...took the victory
in race two after...

146
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,560
...the penalties handed out to
both Stanek and Petecof.

147
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,350
Round two was at Misano in Italy...

148
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,840
...and Petecof bounced
back with two wins...

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,520
...and the third went
to Dennis Hauger.

150
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,360
Petecof led the
championship standings.

151
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,720
Many of these drivers also compete
in the German ADAC F4 championship.

152
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,360
So, they're getting
plenty of experience.

153
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,393
With current f1
drivers like Lance Stroll...

154
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:47,160
...having progressed
through the F4 ranks...

155
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,920
...it's an important step
on the racing ladder.

156
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,320
There are currently 15 f4
championships around the world.

157
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,640
So, in just five years it's
become firmly established.

158
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,213
It may be an Italian championship
however such is the depth...

159
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:09,320
...and strength of the world's
premier junior racing category...

160
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,954
...that the Italian F4
championship also traveled...

161
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:16,680
...to the Hungarian capital together
with the formula regional series.

162
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,007
A fantastic entry of
35 cars including nine...

163
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:23,074
...Italian drivers and a
host of internationals...

164
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,584
...from around the
world lined up for...

165
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,000
...qualifying on the
Hungarian grand prix circuit.

166
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,560
And whilst there were
two twin qualifying sessions...

167
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,680
...it was the same driver
who was fastest in both.

168
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,908
From Oslo in Norway
Dennis Hauger took pole...

169
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:44,240
...position for both race
one and race number two.

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,202
At the start of the first
race Hauger led...

171
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:51,453
...the massive field down into
turn number one but the race...

172
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:54,430
...was not even two laps
old when Oliver Rasmussen...

173
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,480
...tried an overly optimistic
move on Nicholas Crewton...

174
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,160
...eliminating both drivers
and bringing out the safety car.

175
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,400
Amna Al Qubaisi was
then too anxious to restart.

176
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,734
She ran into the
back of one of the BW Team...

177
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,320
...motorsport cars
causing further delay.

178
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,276
The run to the green
flag so, Hauger winning...

179
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:17,900
...the opening race in style
from Gianluca Petecof...

180
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,520
...who did lead the series
coming into this round...

181
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,280
...with the newly announced Mercedes
junior driver Paul Aron in third.

182
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,720
Race two again Hauger lead away from
pole position however a crash...

183
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,290
...between Lorenzo Ferrari and
Daniel Vebster saw the Italian...

184
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,110
...launched into the
barriers at 126k an hour...

185
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,680
...bringing out the red flag.

186
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,240
He was taken to hospital
for precautionary checks.

187
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,960
However the carbon tatas F4 chassis
had done its job perfectly...

188
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,453
...and Lorenzo was back
at the circuit for race three...

189
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:58,920
...to support his Antonelli
motorsport teammate Andrea Rosso.

190
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,613
The red flag also allowed
the Jenzer motorsport team...

191
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:05,760
...to put a new front wing on
Jonny Edgar's Red Bull car...

192
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,520
...after he sustained
damage at the start.

193
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,710
At the restart
Alessandro Famularo...

194
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,640
...and Lucas Roy
argued with each other.

195
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,784
And in turn the
concrete pit wall...

196
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:19,780
...resulting in severe
damage to both cars.

197
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,260
And yet another safety car
and again at the restart...

198
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,593
...Hauger would lead
away to take his second win...

199
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:30,000
...from two starts from the
Russian Michael Belov...

200
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,760
...who continued to impress
coming home in second...

201
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,840
...whilst another podium for Aron
keeps him in the championship chase.

202
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,453
Race three so, Petecof
start on the front role...

203
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,380
...of the grid however
he stalled off the start...

204
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,600
...and would finish lap
number one down in 20th place.

205
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,061
However that became
irrelevant when the red flag...

206
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:53,180
...came out as Axel Gnos
and Nico Gola collided...

207
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,280
...in spectacular fashion
down into turn number one.

208
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,880
The Swiss driver upside
down and in the tire barrier...

209
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,590
...but he was okay
although obviously...

210
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,560
...would not line
up for the restart.

211
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,623
When we did go
green once again it was...

212
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,860
...Hauger this time
who almost stalled...

213
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,460
...although he did
recover quickly as Petecof...

214
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,920
...led the field down
into turn number one.

215
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,513
These two pulled away
from the rest of the field...

216
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:23,600
...with Michael Belov in
third ahead of Josh Dirksen.

217
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,507
Belov though was racing under
investigation after heavy contact...

218
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,920
...with Nicholas Crewton who was
fighting back through the field...

219
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,477
...and ultimately the
Russian's race was over...

220
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,840
...when he locked
up down into turn one...

221
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,040
...whilst in third place and then
was handed a 10-second penalty.

222
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,453
This allowed Edo Cohen
up into third place...

223
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:46,340
...and a fantastic battle
reached behind between...

224
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,680
...Rasmussen, Alecco,
Edgar, Laganella and Famularo.

225
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,040
On the very final
lap it started to rain.

226
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,920
Petocof under
pressure from Hauger...

227
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,000
...but he held on to
take a fantastic victory.

228
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,600
Dennis was second
with Edo Cohen in third.

229
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,453
We'll pick up highlights
from round four...

230
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,880
...at the Red Bull Ring
in the coming weeks.

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,720
After the break the story
of the Manor F1 team.

232
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,080
This is the story of the
ill-fated Manor grand prix team.

233
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,960
One of many hopeful F1 entrants
that ultimately fell by the wayside.

234
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,160
They entered F1 in 2010
alongside Caterham and Hispania.

235
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,720
The team was formed
as Manor grand prix.

236
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,062
A partnership between
Manor motorsport...

237
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:00,280
...Design Consultancy
Worth Research...

238
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,680
...and Richard
Branson's Virgin group.

239
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,880
For the first season their drivers
were Timo Glock and Lucas di Grassi.

240
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,113
Virgin's car for 2010 the VR01
was the first formula one car...

241
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:16,562
...designed entirely
using computational...

242
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:18,960
...fluid dynamics technology.

243
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,480
However, this led to a
major design flaw in the car...

244
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,927
...resulting in a smaller
fuel tank which meant...

245
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,580
...the team wasn't able
to finish any of the races...

246
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,280
...unless the cars were driven at
a reduced pace to conserve fuel.

247
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,520
I think for the first outing we
should have a good package...

248
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,403
...and now the
interesting part is really...

249
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:43,360
...to sit in the car and see
what we can do with it.

250
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,337
Feels awesome but there has
been so much preparation that...

251
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:49,040
...I'm really looking forward
to sit on the car you know.

252
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,413
I'm eager to get there and get the
whole program going to see how...

253
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,530
...the car is reacting
in every corner...

254
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,720
...and every braking,
every acceleration.

255
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,660
So, I'm really really
anxious to be there driving.

256
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,338
For the first two races
in 2010 neither driver...

257
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:08,800
...managed to finish a race
recording four retirements.

258
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,640
At the Spanish grand prix
both drivers managed to finish.

259
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,596
Despite recording four further
double finishes the team finished...

260
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,481
...at the bottom
of the constructor's...

261
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:20,440
...championship
standings on a tiebreaker.

262
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,603
Their best result
14th place finishes for...

263
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:26,200
...De Grassi and Malaysia
and Glock in Japan...

264
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,030
...put them lower
than Lotus racing...

265
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,320
...and Hispania racing
in the standings.

266
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,533
For 2011 the team retained Timo
Glock but decided to replace...

267
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,354
...Luca de Grassi
with Renault test driver...

268
00:17:40,454 --> 00:17:42,500
...and rookie
Jerome D'ambrosio.

269
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,109
Well it's something
fantastic. I've been...

270
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:49,340
...dreaming of this since
I started motor racing.

271
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,533
So, I think since I'm
eight or seven so, quite...

272
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,800
...a long time nearly when
the last one stopped.

273
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,800
So, it's great, it's a
fantastic achievement...

274
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,833
...and in another way it's
just the beginning so, I just...

275
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:05,880
...have to get my head down
to work and it's an opportunity.

276
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,064
And that I need to
just make the most out...

277
00:18:08,164 --> 00:18:10,480
...of so, really working
hard, just dedicate...

278
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,120
...all I've got to this and
try to be the best out there.

279
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,520
And the best as I can, so get
the best out of out of the car.

280
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,625
I've got something that chance
in having Timo near me he's got...

281
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,120
...a lot of experience obviously...

282
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,020
...it's gonna be quicker
in the beginning...

283
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,828
...and then and
my goal would be to...

284
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:29,060
...just get as close to
him as possible...

285
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,800
...learn from him and
see how we will go.

286
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,099
Everyone's been around bubbling
around the top of the junior...

287
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,520
...Formula for five years, I think
or for four or five years now.

288
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,250
And we had the chance
to have a look at him in...

289
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,960
...the driving sessions and he
did absolutely fantastic yeah.

290
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,860
He didn't put a foot wrong and
was pretty quick the whole time.

291
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,160
Due to the increasing involvement
of Russian car maker Marussia...

292
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,384
...the team entered the
2011 championship under...

293
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:59,080
...the Marussia Virgin racing banner
and with a Russian license.

294
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,720
2010 brought us
lots of excitement...

295
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,200
...a lot of frustration
and sweat.

296
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,710
But it was really
a great opportunity...

297
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,901
...for us to finally
see the result...

298
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:13,077
...of this new digital
way of developing...

299
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:15,160
...a car, how it's stacked up...

300
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,123
...really calibrate ourselves,
not just calibrate...

301
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,440
...where we were in
terms of performance...

302
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,373
...but also what was
needed in terms...

303
00:19:23,473 --> 00:19:26,360
...of taking this next step
forward into 2011.

304
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,271
Despite it being his
first season in F1...

305
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:32,821
...D'ambrosio matched
his more experienced...

306
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,491
...teammate and claimed
the best result for the...

307
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,640
...team two 14th place
finishers in Bahrain and Turkey.

308
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,593
By the third round in
Malaysia, Virgin had four...

309
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,360
...finishes compared to
just one the previous year.

310
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,720
The season progressed and
the team improved their results.

311
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,276
They had 10 double
finishes but still...

312
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:55,400
...finished behind Lotus
and Hispania racing.

313
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,960
2011 ended again with Virgin last
in the constructor's championship.

314
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,560
For 2012 the team
underwent major changes.

315
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,240
In November 2011 Marussia
purchased the controlling stake...

316
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,323
...and following
Virgin's exit from...

317
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:21,480
...the sport the name
changed once again.

318
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,800
This time to Marussia Formula 1.

319
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,733
The team parted company with
worth research and entered...

320
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,200
...a relationship with McLaren
applied technologies for 2012.

321
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,560
We're late running this year;
I mean we started a fresh.

322
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,720
We built the team from scratch
from June last year, June 2011.

323
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,558
And of course,
inevitable delays it's...

324
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,520
...a totally new philosophy
on car design for us...

325
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,760
...and it's an inevitable delay.

326
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,272
For the third season Timo Glock
was retained as a senior driver...

327
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:57,880
...but Jerome D'ambrosio was
replaced with rookie Charles Pic.

328
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,613
Charles stood out in the young
driver test with his consistency...

329
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:04,720
...we did a race simulation test
and it was absolutely fantastic.

330
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,993
And also, his feel of the car,
his feedback and his calmness...

331
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:10,760
...in the car when his communicate
on the radio is first-class.

332
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,552
This test in Abu Dhabi was
not easy for me because...

333
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:18,520
...it was my first experience in
F1 in these two days.

334
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,840
So, I had to try to learn
fast, don't make any mistake...

335
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,612
...and be able to
follow a strict program...

336
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:31,760
...of testing on the
following day.

337
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,440
And give back the right
information to the engineer.

338
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,480
So, it was not an
easy test for me...

339
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,080
...but I think we made it right.

340
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,640
So, I'm very very happy.

341
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,615
Continuing the trend of
pre-season woes an announcement...

342
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:55,628
...was made on the team's
website declaring that...

343
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,934
...the new MR01 had failed
the last of the mandatory...

344
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:02,120
...18 crash tests required
of each car by the FIA.

345
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,128
This meant the team
would miss the final...

346
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:06,909
...test session instead
choosing...

347
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,966
...to concentrate on
passing the crash test...

348
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,000
...in time for the first
race of the year.

349
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,783
That meant the MR01
didn't undergo any significant...

350
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:17,680
...testing prior to the
Australian grand prix.

351
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,315
Marussia managed 13
double finishes in the 20-race...

352
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:25,040
...calendar but at the final
race of the season in Brazil...

353
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,984
...Caterham grabbed 10th
place in the constructor's...

354
00:22:28,084 --> 00:22:30,320
...championship demoting
Marussia to 11th...

355
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,000
...what would happen in 2013.

356
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,800
Next week the latest F1 news
ahead of the mid-season break.

357
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,960
Formula regional Europe
from the Red Bull Ring.

358
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,720
And end of the road
for Manor grand prix.
