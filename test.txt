23-24. A regular on the F1 calendar since 1986, Lewis Hamilton has won the race a record number of times with six victories to his credit.
25-26. So, Budapest I think obviously sweet memories from 2015 where we were able to win the race with after a fantastic start.
27. So, definitely looking forward to go back and repeat what we did.
28-33. I think it's a great place to be obviously always got a lot of fans a lot of German speaking fans as well traveling from Austria and Germany and all the Hungarians which usually are very very enthusiastic and love Formula one, being in town.
34-35. So, the whole city of Budapest is enjoying Formula one and usually on Sunday there's a lot of people coming.
36. So, yeah overall I have great memories to Budapest.
37. It's a beautiful city.
38-39. I enjoy staying there and enjoy the restaurants and the people as well just really loving warm people.
40. The race in Hungary is always a special one for me.
41-42. It's a race that I've won quite a few times so it's definitely circuits of which I'm most confident at.
43-48. The track itself is quite short and often called the Monaco of race tracks just lacking the walls but you have a lot of corners, you have one big straight the main straight and after that a lot of corners not much time to rest in between.
49-50. Usually, it's quite hot the track is bumpy so, it makes it quite tough and physically a big challenge for the drivers.
51. But I think overall it's a place that we love to go.
52. If you look on the most critical part on the simulator.
53. It's turn five.
54. You come through turn four the fast left and going into the right.
55-56. This part is almost the trickiest but then you also could say the last corner which goes on forever.
57. And it's very easy to kind of get going too deep and lose the exit.
58. It's a circuit about braking so heavy braking.
59. Getting the brake balance right.
60. The last sector is always tough because the tires are so hot.
61-62. You have to be really aggressive and it's a bit more like a go-kart circuit.
63-64. You can really throw around the car, you really have to attack the braking zones, you have to be really aggressive.
65. Throwing the car into the corner and then trying to still get the exit.
66. The Hungarian grand prix is on this weekend.
67-69. The Alfa Romeo 159 is one of the world's great racing cars and Alfa Romeo doesn't just retain it as a museum piece.
70. The supercharged 1.5 liter straight eight is kept ready to race.

78. Coming up Italian F4 from Vallelunga and the Hungaroring.
79. And the story of Manor f1.
80-81. Now we turn our attention to what has become an important stepping stone to formula one.
82. The Italian Formula 4 championship.
83-84. The Italian F4 championship powered by Abarth starts its sixth season with record numbers.
85-86. 37 original entries and 33 of the cars would be present at the first round with the federation.
87-88. Actually, having to close the entry list so as not to exceed the track capacity at some circuits.
89. And an incredible entry list it is.
90. Both in terms of quality and the nationality of drivers.
91-93. English, Russians, Brazilians, Finns Israelis and more in what is undoubtedly the most international of the national junior championships.
94-95. In addition to the fact that the best teams in Europe are present on the grid.
96. Including Prema Powerteam.
97. Van Amersfoort Racing.
98. Jenzer Motorsports.
99. VW Team Mï¿½cke Motorsport.
100. Cram Competition and many others.
101-102. Many of the drivers can boast titles from the world of international karting.
103. Including European and world championships and WSK titles.
104-105. Along with drivers who have already attracted the attention of teams such as Sauber, Ferrari and Red Bull.
106-107. So, without a doubt the strongest continental f4 championship got underway at Vallelunga for the first round of 2019.
108. A first round that actually disappointed fans just a little.
109-110. Simply due to the many safety cars that intervened due to the at times horrendous weather conditions at the circuit.
111-114. Between intense rain and glimpses of sunshine the standout was the brilliant performance of Gianluca Petecof who managed to take poll for race one.
115-116. Yeah, it was a really good session, tricky conditions, track drying up a little bit.
117-118. We were able to pull the lap in the end and guarantee pole position, so happy with the session.
119-122. In race one the boy from Brazil starts from pole position and he leads on a wet track remaining on slick tires and withstanding the attacks from behind to take the first win of the season.
123-124. In race two, he finishes on the podium but is penalized for overtaking behind the safety car.
125. But finally, he goes on to win race three with an incredible last lap.
126-127. Passing both the Russian Michael Belov and the German Lucas Roy Alecco to take the win.
128-131. A superb weekend for the Prema Powerteam driver who had to contend with formidable and aggressive opponents and also the changing weather.
132-135. Also noteworthy are the performances of the Czech Roman Stanek a rookie driver with the Sauber junior team who despite winning race two on track suffered the same fate as Petecof.
136-137. A 10 second penalty for passing under yellows and subsequent relegation from victory.
138-140. And also, the Russian Michael Belov competitive all weekend and able to fight with Petecof until the very last lap in race number three.
141-143. Josh Dirksen is the best of the rookies and is also second overall in the general standings behind the Brazilian Petecof.
144-146. The South American from Paraguay Josh Dirksen took the victory in race two after the penalties handed out to both Stanek and Petecof.
147-149. Round two was at Misano in Italy and Petecof bounced back with two wins and the third went to Dennis Hauger.
150. Petecof led the championship standings.
151. Many of these drivers also compete in the German ADAC F4 championship.
152. So, they're getting plenty of experience.
153-155. With current f1 drivers like Lance Stroll having progressed through the F4 ranks it's an important step on the racing ladder.
156. There are currently 15 f4 championships around the world.
157. So, in just five years it's become firmly established.
158-161. It may be an Italian championship however such is the depth and strength of the world's premier junior racing category that the Italian F4 championship also traveled to the Hungarian capital together with the formula regional series.
162-165. A fantastic entry of 35 cars including nine Italian drivers and a host of internationals from around the world lined up for qualifying on the Hungarian grand prix circuit.
166-167. And whilst there were two twin qualifying sessions it was the same driver who was fastest in both.
168-169. From Oslo in Norway Dennis Hauger took pole position for both race one and race number two.
170-174. At the start of the first race Hauger led the massive field down into turn number one but the race was not even two laps old when Oliver Rasmussen tried an overly optimistic move on Nicholas Crewton eliminating both drivers and bringing out the safety car.
175. Amna Al Qubaisi was then too anxious to restart.
176-177. She ran into the back of one of the BW Team motorsport cars causing further delay.
178-181. The run to the green flag so, Hauger winning the opening race in style from Gianluca Petecof who did lead the series coming into this round with the newly announced Mercedes junior driver Paul Aron in third.
182-185. Race two again Hauger lead away from pole position however a crash between Lorenzo Ferrari and Daniel Vebster saw the Italian launched into the barriers at 126k an hour bringing out the red flag.
186. He was taken to hospital for precautionary checks.
187-189. However the carbon tatas F4 chassis had done its job perfectly and Lorenzo was back at the circuit for race three to support his Antonelli motorsport teammate Andrea Rosso.
190-192. The red flag also allowed the Jenzer motorsport team to put a new front wing on Jonny Edgar's Red Bull car after he sustained damage at the start.
193-194. At the restart Alessandro Famularo and Lucas Roy argued with each other.
195-196. And in turn the concrete pit wall resulting in severe damage to both cars.
197-201. And yet another safety car and again at the restart Hauger would lead away to take his second win from two starts from the Russian Michael Belov who continued to impress coming home in second whilst another podium for Aron keeps him in the championship chase.
202-204. Race three so, Petecof start on the front role of the grid however he stalled off the start and would finish lap number one down in 20th place.
205-207. However that became irrelevant when the red flag came out as Axel Gnos and Nico Gola collided in spectacular fashion down into turn number one.
208-210. The Swiss driver upside down and in the tire barrier but he was okay although obviously would not line up for the restart.
211-214. When we did go green once again it was Hauger this time who almost stalled although he did recover quickly as Petecof led the field down into turn number one.
215-216. These two pulled away from the rest of the field with Michael Belov in third ahead of Josh Dirksen.
217-221. Belov though was racing under investigation after heavy contact with Nicholas Crewton who was fighting back through the field and ultimately the Russian's race was over when he locked up down into turn one whilst in third place and then was handed a 10-second penalty.
222-224. This allowed Edo Cohen up into third place and a fantastic battle reached behind between Rasmussen, Alecco, Edgar, Laganella and Famularo.
225. On the very final lap it started to rain.
226-227. Petocof under pressure from Hauger but he held on to take a fantastic victory.
228. Dennis was second with Edo Cohen in third.
229-230. We'll pick up highlights from round four at the Red Bull Ring in the coming weeks.
231. After the break the story of the Manor F1 team.
232. This is the story of the ill-fated Manor grand prix team.
233. One of many hopeful F1 entrants that ultimately fell by the wayside.
234. They entered F1 in 2010 alongside Caterham and Hispania.
235. The team was formed as Manor grand prix.
236-238. A partnership between Manor motorsport Design Consultancy Worth Research and Richard Branson's Virgin group.
239. For the first season their drivers were Timo Glock and Lucas di Grassi.
240-242. Virgin's car for 2010 the VR01 was the first formula one car designed entirely using computational fluid dynamics technology.
243-246. However, this led to a major design flaw in the car resulting in a smaller fuel tank which meant the team wasn't able to finish any of the races unless the cars were driven at a reduced pace to conserve fuel.
247-249. I think for the first outing we should have a good package and now the interesting part is really to sit in the car and see what we can do with it.
250-251. Feels awesome but there has been so much preparation that I'm really looking forward to sit on the car you know.
252-254. I'm eager to get there and get the whole program going to see how the car is reacting in every corner and every braking, every acceleration.
255. So, I'm really really anxious to be there driving.
256-257. For the first two races in 2010 neither driver managed to finish a race recording four retirements.
258. At the Spanish grand prix both drivers managed to finish.
259-261. Despite recording four further double finishes the team finished at the bottom of the constructor's championship standings on a tiebreaker.
262-265. Their best result 14th place finishes for De Grassi and Malaysia and Glock in Japan put them lower than Lotus racing and Hispania racing in the standings.
266-268. For 2011 the team retained Timo Glock but decided to replace Luca de Grassi with Renault test driver and rookie Jerome D'ambrosio.
269-270. Well it's something fantastic. I've been dreaming of this since I started motor racing.
271-272. So, I think since I'm eight or seven so, quite a long time nearly when the last one stopped.
273-275. So, it's great, it's a fantastic achievement and in another way it's just the beginning so, I just have to get my head down to work and it's an opportunity.
276-278. And that I need to just make the most out of so, really working hard, just dedicate all I've got to this and try to be the best out there.
279. And the best as I can, so get the best out of out of the car.
280-285. I've got something that chance in having Timo near me he's got a lot of experience obviously it's gonna be quicker in the beginning and then and my goal would be to just get as close to him as possible learn from him and see how we will go.
286-287. Everyone's been around bubbling around the top of the junior Formula for five years, I think or for four or five years now.
288-289. And we had the chance to have a look at him in the driving sessions and he did absolutely fantastic yeah.
290. He didn't put a foot wrong and was pretty quick the whole time.
291-293. Due to the increasing involvement of Russian car maker Marussia the team entered the 2011 championship under the Marussia Virgin racing banner and with a Russian license.
294-295. 2010 brought us lots of excitement a lot of frustration and sweat.
296-303. But it was really a great opportunity for us to finally see the result of this new digital way of developing a car, how it's stacked up really calibrate ourselves, not just calibrate where we were in terms of performance but also what was needed in terms of taking this next step forward into 2011.
304-307. Despite it being his first season in F1 D'ambrosio matched his more experienced teammate and claimed the best result for the team two 14th place finishers in Bahrain and Turkey.
308-309. By the third round in Malaysia, Virgin had four finishes compared to just one the previous year.
310. The season progressed and the team improved their results.
311-312. They had 10 double finishes but still finished behind Lotus and Hispania racing.
313. 2011 ended again with Virgin last in the constructor's championship.
314. For 2012 the team underwent major changes.
315-317. In November 2011 Marussia purchased the controlling stake and following Virgin's exit from the sport the name changed once again.
318. This time to Marussia Formula 1.
319-320. The team parted company with worth research and entered a relationship with McLaren applied technologies for 2012.
321. We're late running this year; I mean we started a fresh.
322. We built the team from scratch from June last year, June 2011.
323-325. And of course, inevitable delays it's a totally new philosophy on car design for us and it's an inevitable delay.
326-327. For the third season Timo Glock was retained as a senior driver but Jerome D'ambrosio was replaced with rookie Charles Pic.
328-329. Charles stood out in the young driver test with his consistency we did a race simulation test and it was absolutely fantastic.
330-331. And also, his feel of the car, his feedback and his calmness in the car when his communicate on the radio is first-class.
332-333. This test in Abu Dhabi was not easy for me because it was my first experience in F1 in these two days.
334-336. So, I had to try to learn fast, don't make any mistake and be able to follow a strict program of testing on the following day.
337. And give back the right information to the engineer.
338-339. So, it was not an easy test for me but I think we made it right.
340. So, I'm very very happy.
341-344. Continuing the trend of pre-season woes an announcement was made on the team's website declaring that the new MR01 had failed the last of the mandatory 18 crash tests required of each car by the FIA.
345-348. This meant the team would miss the final test session instead choosing to concentrate on passing the crash test in time for the first race of the year.
349-350. That meant the MR01 didn't undergo any significant testing prior to the Australian grand prix.
351-355. Marussia managed 13 double finishes in the 20-race calendar but at the final race of the season in Brazil Caterham grabbed 10th place in the constructor's championship demoting Marussia to 11th what would happen in 2013.
356. Next week the latest F1 news ahead of the mid-season break.
357. Formula regional Europe from the Red Bull Ring.
358. And end of the road for Manor grand prix.
